## `ti85-vat.asm`: TI-85 VAT Viewer

Remember TI-85 and ZShell?

TI-85 used to store variables, including STRINGs that housed that ZShell Tetris, in a Variable Allocation Table (VAT).
I wrote this viewer to browse the VAT in preparation for building a solid state expansion drive with a friend (never completed).
